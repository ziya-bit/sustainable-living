        <h2 class="center">sustainable living vs zero waste</h2>
        <p>Sustainable living is a broad concept that aims to reduce our environmental impact, while zero waste focuses specifically on reducing the amount of trash we produce. Sustainable living encompasses a wide range of actions, while zero waste emphasizes reducing single-use plastics and minimizing waste generation.</p>
            <p>Sustainable living
            Aims to reduce our environmental impact in a variety of ways, such as using fewer resources, consuming less, and choosing sustainable transportation. It considers the social and economic implications of our choices</p>
           
            <p>Zero waste Focuses on reducing the amount of trash we produce, particularly single-use plastics. It promotes reuse, recycling, and conservation programs, and considers the entire life-cycle of products and processes.</p>

            the impact of sustainable living
        </h2>
        <p>Sustainable living is vital for our health â€” and our planet's health. Living sustainably can improve our life balance by reducing our dependence on vehicles or machinery. By being less reliant on vehicles, we're more likely to walk or cycle, which helps us create healthier habits.</p>
        <p>Sustainable living can have many positive impacts on nature, including:
            Environmental preservation. Sustainable living can help preserve the environment by reducing your carbon footprint, conserving resources, and minimizing pollution. Improved air and water quality. Sustainable living can lead to cleaner air and water by choosing sustainable products, reducing waste, minimizing the use of harmful chemicals, and supporting environmentally friendly initiatives.
            Mitigating climate change. Sustainable practices can help mitigate and adapt to climate change by conserving natural resources, using renewable energy, and reducing greenhouse gases. Promoting biodiversity. Sustainable practices can help promote biodiversity.</p>
        <p>So, what are the impact on not living sustainably? Rising sea levels. Worsening living conditions for lower-income communities, as there is more trash, worse air, and so on. Declining soil quality, and likely the reduced nutritional quality of our food. Fewer green spaces to enjoy in cities and across the world.</p>
